# Password Strength Checker

Welcome to my first project: a simple yet functional **Password Strength Checker**. This tool utilises **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a basic webpage that helps users assess the strength of their passwords.

## Features

- **Interactive Strength Bar**: Displays password strength dynamically based on user input.
- **Customisable Criteria**: Includes checkboxes for common strong password features (e.g., uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, etc.).
- **Real-time Feedback**: As users modify their password, the strength bar adjusts accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing interactive and dynamic functionality.

## How It Works

1. Open the webpage in any modern web browser.
2. Enter a password in the input field.
3. Check the boxes for criteria you want the password to meet (e.g., include numbers, special characters, etc.).
4. Observe the strength bar increase or decrease as the criteria are met.
